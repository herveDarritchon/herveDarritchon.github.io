I have found quite a lot of blogging platforms free on Internet (<a href=https://www.blogger.com/>blogger.com</a>, <a href=https://medium.com/>medium.com</a>, &mldr;). But I didn&rsquo;t want to be locked down to one platform and as a developper I wanted to have the same process as coding. So I shorty felt the need to have something simple, something very similar to my day to day job, it&rsquo;s why I chose to do my content in markdown and to deploy it as I push code to a git repo.</p><h2 id=why-hugo>Why Hugo</h2><p>For my blog, I didn&rsquo;t want something fancy, heavy, low to load and I want it free and with no content added by the platform which could divert the reader from my content. And as I said, I wanted to write my content in Markdown so I knew I definitely need some kind of tool to generate a static blog site from my Markdown files.</p><p>After searching a bit, I found some tools ike (<a href=https://jekyllrb.com/>Jeckyll</a>, <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>, &mldr;). I could have chose eaither of these two blog engine but I chose <strong>Hugo</strong> because it is written in <a href=https://go.dev/>Go</a> and not in <a href=https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/>Ruby</a> :) If I have to learn something I prefer to learn some Go than some Ruby ;)</p><p>Now, I have to choose how to deploy it !</p><h2 id=why-github-pages>Why Github Pages</h2><p>I have some content (e.g. some md files) and I want to deploy it as I deploy my apps in the cloud so I have to choose a Git repository. The two main tools are <a href=https://github.com/>Github</a> and <a href=https://gitlab.com/>Gitlab</a>.</p><p>I have to be honest with you if I had followed my ruled in force I would have chosen Gitlab because it is the repository I used in my day to day work so I have quite a good knowledge of Gitlab pipeline et Hugo is very well integrated with Gitlab. So my advice is :</p><blockquote><p>Use Gitlab with Hugo :)</p></blockquote><p>But it is always good to learn so I have chosen Github because I don&rsquo;t know Github Actions and I want to learn something new when I can.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>I have a good Workflow to do and deploy my Blog. I have a bunch of markdown files with versionning using Git and when I push my new content (using <code>git commit</code>), the new version of my Blog is automatically deployed to my <a href=https://hervedarritchon.github.io>Github Pages</a>.</p><p>This is really what I wanted, something simple, something close to how I work and using Hugo Themes I have something with a somehow good looking.</p></main><script>window.ga=window.ga||function(){(ga.q=ga.q||[]).push(arguments)},ga.l=+new Date,ga('create','UA-214081111-1','auto'),ga('send','pageview')</script><script async src=https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js></script></div></body></html>
